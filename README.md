# perl-disassembler

A simple disassembler written in Perl

I did this back when I was taking a Reverse Engineering course in Grad School and recently found it on an old computer. I have some various other projects from those days but I still need to look through those to see if any of them are at all interesting.

I don't remember why I wrote this in perl - if it was a requirement or just what I felt like doing at the time. I also don't recall the processor manual these opcodes are from! Oh well. It's just preserved for the novelty.
